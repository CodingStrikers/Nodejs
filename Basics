You must have only one package.json in the entire folder.

A folder can have many js file each performing different operations but will have only one master js file.

You can access one js text,array,object and functions.

A) Text and functions can be accessed through by using module.export

file1.js

const r=function(){
return "You are gonna win"};

modules.export=r;

file2.js

const k=require('./path of file1.js');
const g=k();
console.log(g);

B)

const p={
Name:'Vishnu',
BAtch:'b3'}

to send this u need to use

exports.b=p;

file2.js

const d=require('./pathoffile1.js);
console.log(d.b);
